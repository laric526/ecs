### Battle Testing
I'm currently remaking Wii Tanks using it and fixing any bugs and adding any new features I need, so it should be usable for making a game.

##### NOTE:
Most of the work is being done on a school Chromebook, so I have no local test environment, so there are a ton of microscopic commits for tiny changes and often several while fixing a bug.
